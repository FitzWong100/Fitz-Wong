	<h1 class="introheader"><br><br>How'd I get into Web Development?</h1>
	<p class="intro"><br><br>

	<br>
	<br>
	I started doing web development when my sister, Mirna Wong was working as a director for the Department of Consumer Affairs for the great city of New York.  This was in 2014, and what struck me about her experience there is that the fundamental technology needed to improve the lives of New Yorkers was gravely outdated.  This was appalling to me.  It was my own shock to find out just how under staffed many of our city agencies were of technology professionals.  At the time I was very big on freelancing for events and media work.  I decided to take a peek into IT and how some of this computer stuff worked.  I asked myself, how can it be so difficult to engage people into the IT field so our cities can run more efficiently.<br><br>It is imperative that our local and federal governments be updated to handle the next generation while reaching to a much higher standard.  We can do this.  Well, it was to my surprise that while I was looking into the IT field I began to fall in love with it.  Technology as a whole was never really something I was exposed to as a child.  As an adult, I found a deep respect for the possibilities that we can create for the future of this country and I realized that learning IT would grant me the opportunity to help the lives of the middle class.  <br><br>

	<br>
	<br>
	I would like to use Front End Development to provide service, access, and empowerment to the middle class who are currently struggling with the financial burden that this country is facing.  It is a difficult time for many of our friends and neighbors.  I am confident and I am very hopeful that with technology, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.  I am dedicated to providing opportunities to many people that I had the privelege of receiving myself.<br><br>
	Now my work experience: I have been in retail customer sales for many years since 2005 through various position from Circuit City to Cablevision. I have also worked in the media industry through various production position on projects in New York City. I have also worked for event companies fitting different roles in many functions.  I have been the "tech support" guy, as well as the labor staff for many big events in New York City. I have experience in completing high pressure deadlines and can ensure efficiency in all my work. I have taken two courses for Front End Development and feel ready to take on projects and create/maintain websites for clients that desire it.</p>

<p class="block"><strong>Please note:</strong> I am currently working on several projects which implement web media technology into political legislation for the future generations to come. <br>Web media technology will benefit many facets of government such as: education, healthcare and crime reform.  Our goal is to make a more efficient government.</p>
